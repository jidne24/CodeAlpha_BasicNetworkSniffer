# 🗺️ Talk Map Network Sniffer

**Talk Map Network Sniffer** is an advanced, AI-enhanced network packet sniffer designed to capture, analyze, and visually represent real-time network traffic patterns. Beyond basic packet inspection, it integrates machine learning to map behavioral patterns and anomalies on an intuitive visual dashboard.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Packet Capture**: Intercepts and analyzes live network traffic using raw sockets or `scapy`.
- 📊 **Protocol Analysis**: Parses and summarizes packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
- 🧠 **Behavioral Visualization**: Uses ML techniques to detect and display communication flows and anomalies.
- 📈 **Live Dashboard**: Presents real-time traffic maps using Python-based visualization tools.
- 💾 **Logging Support**: Optionally stores traffic data for offline analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (core logic)
- **Scapy / socket** (packet sniffing)
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** (visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (optional ML features)
- **Tkinter / Streamlit / Flask** (UI options – choose as needed)
